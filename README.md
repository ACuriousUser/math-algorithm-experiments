## Problem 1: Hypercube Vertex from Hyperplane Intersections

### Problem Statement

Given:
- **N** dimensions
- A set of **m** hyperplanes, each defined by a linear equation **a** · **x** = b
- A **guarantee** that exactly one point satisfies all constraints

Find the unique point **x** ∈ {-1, 1}^N (a vertex of the N-dimensional hypercube
centered at the origin) that lies on all of the provided hyperplanes.

### Parameters
- **m ≈ N/3** — far fewer equations than variables
- **N up to millions** (aspirational)
- **Sparse**: each equation has ~3 non-zero coefficients in {-1, 1}
- **Unique solution guaranteed**

### Current Approach

See `ellipsoid-approach.md` for the full algorithm design and exploration history.

**Summary**: Guess-and-flip with ellipsoid fitness. Choose a candidate vertex,
measure how compatible it is with the constraints using an ellipsoid-based
fitness function, flip variables to improve fitness. The correct vertex
has the highest fitness. No local maxima with the uniqueness guarantee.
